## Step 5 — Write `Tasks/0000-TASK.md` (always identical)

```markdown
# Task 0000 — Initialize Workspace

## Goal
Verify the workspace is clean and create the feature branch across all repos in the deck.

## Steps
1. Run `hv_status` on the deck (see `../deck.md` for the exact call)
2. If all repos are clean and on the default branch → run `hv_init`
3. If all repos are clean and on a feature branch with all PRs merged → run `hv_next`
4. If any repo is dirty → STOP. Investigate before proceeding.
   - Exception: dirty repo with a merged PR → hv_stash → hv_next → hv_unstash
5. Run `hv_status` again to confirm all repos are on the new feature branch, all clean
6. Record the generated branch name in `../deck.md`

## Definition of done
All repos on the new feature branch, all clean. Branch name recorded in deck.md.
```
