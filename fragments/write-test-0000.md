## Step 6 — Write `Test/0000-TEST.md` (always identical)

```markdown
# Test 0000 — Workspace Initialized

## TC-001 — All repos on feature branch
Run `hv_status` on the deck.
Pass: every repo shows the same feature branch name, no repo is on the default branch.
Fail: any repo is on the default branch or a different branch.

## TC-002 — All repos clean
Pass: hv_status shows no dirty repos.
Fail: any repo shows uncommitted changes, unpushed commits, or stash entries.

## TC-003 — Branch name recorded
Open `../deck.md`.
Pass: the Branch field is filled in with the generated branch name (not "TBD").
Fail: Branch field still says TBD or is missing.
```
